MSc. Computer Science graduate school application materials.

As a UoPeople(https://www.uopeople.edu/) Computer Science undergraduate, one needs to find universities that accept UoPeople grades because as of 1st September 2023, UoPeople is not WASC accredited though it is accredited by the Distance Education Accrediting Commission. The Distance Education Accrediting Commission (DEAC) is listed by the U.S. Department of Education as a recognized accrediting agency.

I used these materials to apply to 74 graduate schools for a master's in Computer Science.
Please make improvements on them and give me more ideas on how to improve them, so as to make this process seamless.

Here you shall find Python scripts to email graduate schools from your Gmail, initially, you can scrape the information, but that shall depend on you.

Here you shall also find CSV templates for emailing your professors for letters of recommendation.
